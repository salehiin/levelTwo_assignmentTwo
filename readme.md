1. Register a new ranger with provided data with name = 'Derek Fox' and region = 'Coastal Plains'
2. Count unique species ever sighted. üêÜ
3. Find all sightings where the location includes "Pass".
4. List each ranger's name and their total number of sightings.
5. List species that have never been sighted.
6. Show the most recent 2 sightings.
7. Update all species discovered before year 1800 to have status 'Historic'.
8. Label each sighting's time of day as 'Morning', 'Afternoon', or 'Evening'. üêÜ
